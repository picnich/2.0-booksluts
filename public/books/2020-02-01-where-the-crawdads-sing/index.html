Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her.</li><li>But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world–until the unthinkable happens.</li><li>In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</li><li>The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures.</li></ul><hr><ul> <li>I wasn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.</li><li>His dad had told him many times that the definition of a real man is one who cries without shame, reads poetry with his heart, feels opera in his soul, and does what’s necessary to defend a woman.</li><li>Unworthy boys make a lot of noise</li><li>Autumn leaves don't fall, they fly. They take their time and wander on this their only chance to soar.</li><li>She laughed for his sake, something she’d never done. Giving away another piece of herself just to have someone else.</li></ul><hr><p>#87831b</p><p>#87831b</p><p>Normal People</p><p>normal-people</p><p>#87831b</p></div></article></main><footer><ul class="footer-navigation"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/pages/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/pages/contact">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/pages/books">Books</a></li></ul></footer><script>if (window.netlifyIdentity) {
