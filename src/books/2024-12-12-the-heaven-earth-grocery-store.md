        “You can forever remember the wrongs done to you as long as you live,”
        she said. “But if you forget ’em and go on living, it’s almost as good
        as forgiving.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        In 1972, when workers in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, were digging the
        foundations for a new housing development, the last thing they expected
        to uncover was a human skeleton. Who the skeleton was and how it got
        buried there were just two of the long-held secrets that had been kept
        for decades by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated
        neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by
        side, sharing ambitions and sorrows.
    - paragraph: >-
        Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Chona ran the
        Heaven & Earth Grocery Store, which served the neighborhood's quirky
        collection of blacks and European immigrants, helped by her husband,
        Moshe, a Romanian-born theater owner who integrated the town's first
        dance hall. When the state came looking for a deaf black child, claiming
        that the boy needed to be institutionalized, Chicken Hill's
        residents—roused by Chona's kindess and the courage of a local black
        worker named Nate Timblin—banded together to keep the boy safe.
    - paragraph: >-
        As the novel unfolds, it becomes clear how much the people of Chicken
        Hill have to struggle to survive at the margins of white Christian
        America and how damaging bigotry, hypocrisy, and deceit can be to a
        community. When the truth is revealed about the skeleton, the boy, and
        the part the town’s establishment played in both, McBride shows that it
        is love and community—heaven and earth—that ultimately sustain us.
