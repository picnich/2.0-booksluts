        “Americans have long been trained to see the deficiencies of people
        rather than policy. It's a pretty easy mistake to make: People are in
        our faces. Policies are distant. We are particularly poor at seeing the
        policies lurking behind the struggles of people.”

        “The opposite of racist isn't 'not racist.' It is 'anti-racist.' What's
        the difference? One endorses either the idea of a racial hierarchy as a
        racist, or racial equality as an anti-racist. One either believes
        problems are rooted in groups of people, as a racist, or locates the
        roots of problems in power and policies, as an anti-racist. One either
        allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial
        inequities, as an anti-racist. There is no in-between safe space of 'not
        racist.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Ibram X. Kendi's concept of antiracism reenergizes and reshapes the
        conversation about racial justice in America--but even more
        fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about
        ourselves and each other. In How to be an Antiracist, Kendi asks us to
        think about what an antiracist society might look like, and how we can
        play an active role in building it.
    - paragraph: >-
        In this book, Kendi weaves together an electrifying combination of
        ethics, history, law, and science, bringing it all together with an
        engaging personal narrative of his own awakening to antiracism. How to
        Be an Antiracist is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond
        an awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation
        of a truly just and equitable society.
