        “I think Upton Sinclair once wrote that a man has difficulty
        understanding something if his salary depends on his not understanding.”

        “It is a peculiar hallmark of the American economy that you can produce
        a dangerous product and effectively off-load any legal liability for
        whatever destruction that product may cause by pointing to the
        individual responsibility of the consumer.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        The highly anticipated portrait of three generations of the Sackler
        family, by the prize-winning, bestselling author of Say Nothing.
    - paragraph: >-
        The Sackler name adorns the walls of many storied institutions: Harvard,
        the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the
        richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the
        arts and sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however,
        until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and
        marketing OxyContin, a blockbuster painkiller that was a catalyst for
        the opioid crisis.
    - paragraph: >-
        Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing,
        exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling
