  highlights:
    - highlight: >-
        That the beginning and the end may have been chosen for us, the string
        already spun, but the middle had always been left undetermined, to be
        woven and shaped by us.
    - highlight: >-
        I arise in the morning torn between a desire to save the world and a
        desire to savor the world. That makes it hard to plan the day.
  summary:
    - paragraph: Eight ordinary people. One extraordinary choice.
    - paragraph: >-
        It seems like any other day. You wake up, pour a cup of coffee, and head
        out.
    - paragraph: >-
        But today, when you open your front door, waiting for you is a small
        wooden box. This box holds your fate inside: the answer to the exact
        number of years you will live.
    - paragraph: >-
        From suburban doorsteps to desert tents, every person on every continent
        receives the same box. In an instant, the world is thrust into a
        collective frenzy. Where did these boxes come from? What do they mean?
        Is there truth to what they promise?
    - paragraph: >-
        As society comes together and pulls apart, everyone faces the same
        shocking choice: Do they wish to know how long they’ll live? And, if so,
        what will they do with that knowledge?
    - paragraph: >-
        The Measure charts the dawn of this new world through an unforgettable
        cast of characters whose decisions and fates interweave with one
        another: best friends whose dreams are forever entwined, pen pals
        finding refuge in the unknown, a couple who thought they didn’t have to
        rush, a doctor who cannot save himself, and a politician whose box
        becomes the powder keg that ultimately changes everything.
