        To live in a city is to live the life that it was built for, to adapt to its schedule and rhythms, to move within the transit layout made for you during the morning and evening rush, winding through the crowds of fellow commuters. To live in a city is to consume its offerings. To eat at its restaurants. To drink at its bars. To shop at its stores. To pay its sales taxes. To give a dollar to its homeless.

        To live in a city is to take part in and to propagate its impossible systems. To wake up. To go to work in the morning. It is also to take pleasure in those systems because, otherwise, who could repeat the same routines, year in, year out?

        A second chance doesn't mean you're in the clear. In many ways, it is the more difficult thing. Because a second chance means that you have to try harder. You must rise to the challenge without the blind optimism of ignorance.”

  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Candace Chen, a millennial drone self-sequestered in a Manhattan office
        tower, is devoted to routine. So she barely notices when a plague of
        biblical proportions sweeps New York. Then Shen Fever spreads. Families
        flee. Companies halt operations. The subways squeak to a halt. Soon
        entirely alone, still unfevered, she photographs the eerie, abandoned
        city as the anonymous blogger NY Ghost.
    - paragraph: >-
        Candace won’t be able to make it on her own forever, though. Enter a
        group of survivors, led by the power-hungry IT tech Bob. They’re
        traveling to a place called the Facility, where, Bob promises, they will
        have everything they need to start society anew. But Candace is carrying
        a secret she knows Bob will exploit. Should she escape from her
        rescuers?
    - paragraph: >-
        A send-up and takedown of the rituals, routines, and missed
        opportunities of contemporary life, Ling Ma’s Severance is a quirky
        coming-of-adulthood tale and satire.
