  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Candace Chen, a millennial drone self-sequestered in a Manhattan office
        tower, is devoted to routine. So she barely notices when a plague of
        biblical proportions sweeps New York. Then Shen Fever spreads. Families
        flee. Companies halt operations. The subways squeak to a halt. Soon
        entirely alone, still unfevered, she photographs the eerie, abandoned
        city as the anonymous blogger NY Ghost.
    - paragraph: >-
        Candace won’t be able to make it on her own forever, though. Enter a
        group of survivors, led by the power-hungry IT tech Bob. They’re
        traveling to a place called the Facility, where, Bob promises, they will
        have everything they need to start society anew. But Candace is carrying
        a secret she knows Bob will exploit. Should she escape from her
        rescuers?
    - paragraph: >-
        A send-up and takedown of the rituals, routines, and missed
        opportunities of contemporary life, Ling Ma’s Severance is a quirky
        coming-of-adulthood tale and satire.
