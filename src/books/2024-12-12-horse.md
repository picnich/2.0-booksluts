        “You have to know that bigots are unwittingly handing you an edge. By
        thinking you're lesser than they are, they underestimate you. Lean on
        that. Learn to use it, and you'll get the upper hand.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Kentucky, 1850. An enslaved groom named Jarret and a bay foal forge a
        bond of understanding that will carry the horse to record-setting
        victories across the South. When the nation erupts in civil war, an
        itinerant young artist who has made his name on paintings of the
        racehorse takes up arms for the Union. On a perilous night, he reunites
        with the stallion and his groom, very far from the glamor of any
        racetrack.
    - paragraph: >-
        New York City, 1954. Martha Jackson, a gallery owner celebrated for
        taking risks on edgy contemporary painters, becomes obsessed with a
        nineteenth-century equestrian oil painting of mysterious provenance.
    - paragraph: >-
        Washington, DC, 2019. Jess, a Smithsonian scientist from Australia, and
        Theo, a Nigerian-American art historian, find themselves unexpectedly
        connected through their shared interest in the horse--one studying the
        stallion's bones for clues to his power and endurance, the other
        uncovering the lost history of the unsung Black horsemen who were
        critical to his racing success.
    - paragraph: >-
        Based on the remarkable true story of the record-breaking thoroughbred
        Lexington, Horse is a novel of art and science, love and obsession, and
        our unfinished reckoning with racism.
