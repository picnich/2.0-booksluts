        “I love statistics because they place what happens to a scrap of

  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        The Sentence asks what we owe to the living, the dead, to the reader and
        to the book.
    - paragraph: >-
        A small independent bookstore in Minneapolis is haunted from November
        2019 to November 2020 by the store's most annoying customer. Flora dies
        on All Souls' Day, but she simply won't leave the store. Tookie, who has
        landed a job selling books after years of incarceration that she
        survived by reading with murderous attention, must solve the mystery of
        this haunting while at the same time trying to understand all that
        occurs in Minneapolis during a year of grief, astonishment, isolation,
        and furious reckoning.
    - paragraph: >-
        The Sentence begins on All Souls' Day 2019 and ends on All Souls' Day
        2020. Its mystery and proliferating ghost stories during this one year
        propel a narrative as rich, emotional, and profound as anything Louise
        Erdrich has written.
