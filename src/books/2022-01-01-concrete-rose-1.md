        “It's kinda like how we have to do with ourselves. Get rid of the things
        that don't do us any good. If it won't help the rose grow, you've gotta
        let it go.”

        “Son, one of the biggest lies ever told is that black men don't feel
        emotions. Guess it's easier not to see us as human when you think we're
        heartless. Fact of the matter is, we feel things. Hurt, pain, sadness,
        all of it. We got a right to show them feelings as much as anybody
        else.”

        “You gotta love people enough to let them go, especially when you're the
        reason they're gone.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        International phenomenon Angie Thomas revisits Garden Heights seventeen
        years before the events of The Hate U Give in this searing and poignant
        exploration of Black boyhood and manhood.
    - paragraph: >-
        If there’s one thing seventeen-year-old Maverick Carter knows, it’s that
        a real man takes care of his family. As the son of a former gang legend,
        Mav does that the only way he knows how: dealing for the King Lords.
        With this money he can help his mom, who works two jobs while his dad’s
        in prison.
    - paragraph: >-
        Life’s not perfect, but with a fly girlfriend and a cousin who always
        has his back, Mav’s got everything under control.
    - paragraph: 'Until, that is, Maverick finds out he’s a father.'
    - paragraph: >-
        Suddenly he has a baby, Seven, who depends on him for everything. But
        it’s not so easy to sling dope, finish school, and raise a child. So
        when he’s offered the chance to go straight, he takes it. In a world
        where he’s expected to amount to nothing, maybe Mav can prove he’s
        different.
    - paragraph: >-
        When King Lord blood runs through your veins, though, you can't just
        walk away. Loyalty, revenge, and responsibility threaten to tear Mav
        apart, especially after the brutal murder of a loved one. He’ll have to
        figure out for himself what it really means to be a man.
