        In this exhilarating novel, two friends--often in love, but never
        lovers--come together as creative partners in the world of video game

        On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam
        Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on
        the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends
        she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a
        legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends,
        intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even
        graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo.
        Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and
        Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't
        protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their
        hearts.

        Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach,
        California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's
        Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately
        imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity,
        disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above
        all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love
        story, but it is not one you have read before.
