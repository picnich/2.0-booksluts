  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        A spellbinding story about two girls whose friendship is so intense it
        not only threatens to destroy them, it changes the trajectory of
        history.
    - paragraph: >-
        Marie Antoine is the charismatic, spoiled daughter of a sugar baron. At
        12 years old, with her blond curls and her unparalleled sense of
        whimsey, she's the leader of all the children in the Golden Mile, an
        affluent strip of 19th century Montreal. Until one day in 1873, when
        Sadie Arnett, dark-haired, sly, and brilliant, moves to the
        neighborhood.
    - paragraph: >-
        Marie and Sadie are immediately united by their passion and intensity,
        and they attract and repel each other in ways that light each of them on
        fire. Marie with her bubbly charm sees the light and sweetness of the
        world, whereas Sadie's obsession with darkness is all consuming. Soon
        their childlike games take on a thrill of danger and then become deadly.
    - paragraph: >-
        Forced to separate, they spend their teenage years engaged in acts of
        alternating innocence and depravity--until a singular event unites them
        once more, with dizzying effects. And after Marie inherits her father's
        sugar empire and Sadie disappears into the city's gritty underworld, a
        revolution of the working class begins to foment. Each of them will have
        unexpected roles to play in events that upend their city--the only
        question is whether they will find each other once more.
    - paragraph: >-
        Traveling from a repressive finishing school to a vibrant brothel,
        taking readers firsthand into the brutality of factory life and the
        opulent lives of Montreal's wealthy, When We Lost Our Heads dazzlingly
        explores gender and power, sex and desire, class and status, and the
        terrifying power of the human heart when it can't let someone go.
