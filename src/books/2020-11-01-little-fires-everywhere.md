        “He can guess, but he won't ever know, not really. What it was like,
        what she was thinking, everything she'd never told him. Whether she
        thought he'd failed her, or whether she wanted him to let her go. This,
        more than anything, makes him feel that she is gone.”

        “She smelled of home... as if home had never been a place, but had
        always been this little person whom she'd carried alongside her.”

        “You’ll always be sad about this. But it doesn’t mean you made the wrong
        choice. It’s just something that you have to carry.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything
        is planned--from the layout of the winding roads, to the colors of the
        houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no
        one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding
        principle is playing by the rules.
    - paragraph: >-
        Enter Mia Warren--an enigmatic artist and single mother--who arrives in
        this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house
        from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all
        four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia
        carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo
        that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.
    - paragraph: >-
        When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a
        Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides
        the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia
        and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's
        past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs.
    - paragraph: >-
        Little Fires Everywhere explores the weight of secrets, the nature of
        art and identity, and the ferocious pull of motherhood--and the danger
        of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.
