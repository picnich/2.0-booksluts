        “When he asked my grandmother if she would mind being poor, she said she
        would be happy just to have her daughter and himself: 'If you have love,
        even plain water is sweet.”

        “As a child, my idea of the West was that it was a miasma of poverty and
        misery, like that of the homeless 'Little Match Girl'in the Hans
        Christian Andersen story. When I was in the boarding nursery and did not
        want to finish my food, the teacher would say:'Think of all the starving
        children in the capitalist world!”
    - highlight: “...boredom was as exhausting as backbreaking labor.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        The story of three generations in twentieth-century China that blends
        the intimacy of memoir and the panoramic sweep of eyewitness history—a
        bestselling classic in thirty languages with more than ten million
        copies sold around the world, now with a new introduction from the
        author.
    - paragraph: >-
        An engrossing record of Mao’s impact on China, an unusual window on the
        female experience in the modern world, and an inspiring tale of courage
        and love, Jung Chang describes the extraordinary lives and experiences
        of her family members: her grandmother, a warlord’s concubine; her
        mother’s struggles as a young idealistic Communist; and her parents’
        experience as members of the Communist elite and their ordeal during the
        Cultural Revolution. Chang was a Red Guard briefly at the age of
        fourteen, then worked as a peasant, a “barefoot doctor,” a steelworker,
        and an electrician. As the story of each generation unfolds, Chang
        captures in gripping, moving—and ultimately uplifting—detail the cycles
        of violent drama visited on her own family and millions of others caught
        in the whirlwind of history.
