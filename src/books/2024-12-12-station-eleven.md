  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Kirsten Raymonde will never forget the night Arthur Leander, the famous
        Hollywood actor, had a heart attack on stage during a production of King
        Lear. That was the night when a devastating flu pandemic arrived in the
        city, and within weeks, civilization as we know it came to an end.
    - paragraph: >-
        Twenty years later, Kirsten moves between the settlements of the altered
        world with a small troupe of actors and musicians. They call themselves
        The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated themselves to keeping
        the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive in St.
        Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten
        the tiny band’s existence. And as the story takes off, moving back and
        forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic,
        the strange twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed.
