        “Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will,
        your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is
        revealed by your actions.”

        “But no artist, I now realize, can be satisfied with art alone. There is
        a natural craving for recognition which cannot be gain-said.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        First, there were ten—a curious assortment of strangers summoned as
        weekend guests to a little private island off the coast of Devon. Their
        host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be
        found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're
        unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has
        been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in
        every room of the mansion:
    - paragraph: >-
        "Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then
        there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept
        himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon;
        One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys
        chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six.
        Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then
        there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery
        and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red
        herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys
        walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two
        little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was
        one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and
        then there were none."
    - paragraph: >-
        When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme,
        terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out,
        there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who
        will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.
