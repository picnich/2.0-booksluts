        “That’s how it feels right now, he thinks, kneeling beside her, rinsing
        her hair: as though his love for her will outstrip the limits of his
        body. The walls could fall away, even the whole city, and the brightness
        of that feeling would not wane.”

        From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, the

        Marie-Laure lives in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where her
        father works. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and
        daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure’s
        reclusive great uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they
        carry what might be the museum’s most valuable and dangerous jewel.

        In a mining town in Germany, Werner Pfennig, an orphan, grows up with
        his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find that brings
        them news and stories from places they have never seen or imagined.
        Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new
        instruments and is enlisted to use his talent to track down the
        resistance. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner,
        Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to
        one another.
