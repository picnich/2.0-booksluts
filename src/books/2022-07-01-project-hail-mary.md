        “Oh thank God. I can’t imagine explaining “sleep” to someone who had
        never heard of it. Hey, I’m going to fall unconscious and hallucinate
        for a while. By the way, I spend a third of my time doing this. And if I
        can’t do it for a while, I go insane and eventually die. No need for
        concern.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance
        mission—and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.
    - paragraph: >-
        Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his
        own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.
    - paragraph: >-
        All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And
        he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home,
        with nothing but two corpses for company.
    - paragraph: >-
        His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that
        an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this
        tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific
        mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.
    - paragraph: >-
        And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years
        away, he’s got to do it all alone.
    - paragraph: Or does he?
