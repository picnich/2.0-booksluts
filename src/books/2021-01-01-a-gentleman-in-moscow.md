        “After all, what can a first impression tell us about someone we’ve just
        met for a minute in the lobby of a hotel? For that matter, what can a
        first impression tell us about anyone? Why, no more than a chord can
        tell us about Beethoven, or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By their
        very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully
        contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our
        reconsideration—and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion
        until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every
        possible hour.”

        "One might well draw the conclusion, that a man prone to pacing is a man
        who will act judiciously- given the unusual amount of time he has
        allocated to the consideration of causes and consequences, of
        ramifications and repercussions. But it had been the Count's experience
        that men prone to pace are always on the verge of acting impulsively.
        For while the men who pace are being whipped along by logic, it is a
        multifaceted sort of logic, which brings them no closer to a clear
        understanding, or even a state of conviction. Rather, it leaves them at
        such a loss that they end up exposed to the influence of the merest
        whim, to the seduction of the rash or reckless act -almost as if they
        had never considered the matter at all."

        With his breakout debut novel, Rules of Civility, Amor Towles
        established himself as a master of absorbing, sophisticated fiction,
        bringing late 1930s Manhattan to life with splendid atmosphere and a
        flawless command of style. Readers and critics were enchanted; as NPR
        commented, “Towles writes with grace and verve about the mores and
        manners of a society on the cusp of radical change.”

        A Gentleman in Moscow immerses us in another elegantly drawn era with
        the story of Count Alexander Rostov.
    - paragraph: >-
        When, in 1922, he is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik
        tribunal, the count is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a
        grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable
        man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must
        now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in
        Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly,
        his reduced circumstances provide him a doorway into a much larger world
        of emotional discovery.
    - paragraph: >-
        Brimming with humour, a glittering cast of characters, and one
        beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a
        spell as it relates the count’s endeavour to gain a deeper understanding
        of what it means to be a man of purpose.
