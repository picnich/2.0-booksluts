        “There is always a way out of a situation. Might be ugly. Might leave
        you feeling like the earth had gone and shifted under your feet. But
        there is always a way around.”

        "'I worked it out sitting here. Maybe that's the thing we need to
        understand, Alice. That some things are a gift, even if you don't get to
        keep them.' There was a silence before he spoke again. 'Maybe just to
        know that something this beautiful exists is all we can really ask
        for.'"
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Alice Wright marries handsome American Bennett Van Cleve hoping to
        escape her stifling life in England. But small-town Kentucky quickly
        proves equally claustrophobic, especially living alongside her
        overbearing father-in-law. So when a call goes out for a team of women
        to deliver books as part of Eleanor Roosevelt’s new traveling library,
        Alice signs on enthusiastically.
    - paragraph: >-
        The leader, and soon Alice’s greatest ally, is Margery, a smart-talking,
        self-sufficient woman who’s never asked a man’s permission for anything.
        They will be joined by three other singular women who become known as
        the Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky.
    - paragraph: >-
        What happens to them–and to the men they love–becomes an unforgettable
        drama of loyalty, justice, humanity and passion. These heroic women
        refuse to be cowed by men or by convention. And though they face all
        kinds of dangers in a landscape that is at times breathtakingly
        beautiful, at others brutal, they’re committed to their job: bringing
        books to people who have never had any, arming them with facts that will
        change their lives.
    - paragraph: >-
        Based on a true story rooted in America’s past, The Giver of Stars is
        unparalleled in its scope and epic in its storytelling. Funny,
        heartbreaking, enthralling, it is destined to become a modern classic–a
        richly rewarding novel of women’s friendship, of true love, and of what
        happens when we reach beyond our grasp for the great beyond.
