        “Gradually the waiting began to feel less like waiting and more like
        this was simply what life was: the distracting tasks undertaken while
        the thing you are waiting for continues not to happen.”

        “Things and people moved around me, taking positions in obscure
        hierarchies, participating in systems I didn't know about and never
        would. A complex network of objects and concepts. You live through
        certain things before you understand them. You can't always take the
        analytical position.”

        “Everyone’s always going through something, aren’t they? That’s life,
        basically. It’s just more and more things to go through.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Asharply intelligent novel about two college students and the strange,
        unexpected connection they forge with a married couple.
    - paragraph: >-
        Frances is twenty-one years old, cool-headed, and darkly observant. A
        college student and aspiring writer, she devotes herself to a life of
        the mind--and to the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi, her
        best friend and comrade-in-arms. Lovers at school, the two young women
        now perform spoken-word poetry together in Dublin, where a journalist
        named Melissa spots their potential. Drawn into Melissa's orbit, Frances
        is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and
        tall, handsome husband. Private property, Frances believes, is a
        cultural evil--and Nick, a bored actor who never quite lived up to his
        potential, looks like patriarchy made flesh. But however amusing their
        flirtation seems at first, it gives way to a strange intimacy neither of
        them expect. As Frances tries to keep her life in check, her
        relationships increasingly resist her control: with Nick, with her
        difficult and unhappy father, and finally even with Bobbi. Desperate to
        reconcile herself to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body,
        Frances's intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new: a
        painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment.
    - paragraph: >-
        Written with gem-like precision and probing intelligence, Conversations
        With Friends is wonderfully alive to the pleasures and dangers of youth.
