        “If I've thought of my mother as callous, and many times I have, then it
        is important to remember what a callus is: the hardened tissue that
        forms over a wound.”

        “It took me many years to realize that it’s hard to live in this world.
        I don’t mean the mechanics of living, because for most of us, our hearts
        will beat, our lungs will take in oxygen, without us doing anything at
        all to tell them to. For most of us, mechanically, physically, it’s
        harder to die than it is to live. But still we try to die. We drive too
        fast down winding roads, we have sex with strangers without wearing
        protection, we drink, we use drugs. We try to squeeze a little more life
        out of our lives. It’s natural to want to do that. But to be alive in
        the world, every day, as we are given more and more and more, as the
        nature of “what we can handle” changes and our methods for how we handle
        it change, too, that’s something of a miracle.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Yaa Gyasi's stunning follow-up to her acclaimed national best seller
        Homegoing is a powerful, raw, intimate, deeply layered novel about a
        Ghanaian family in Alabama.
    - paragraph: >-
        Gifty is a fifth-year candidate in neuroscience at Stanford School of
        Medicine studying reward-seeking behavior in mice and the neural
        circuits of depression and addiction. Her brother, Nana, was a gifted
        high school athlete who died of a heroin overdose after a knee injury
        left him hooked on OxyContin. Her suicidal mother is living in her bed.
        Gifty is determined to discover the scientific basis for the suffering
        she sees all around her.
    - paragraph: >-
        But even as she turns to the hard sciences to unlock the mystery of her
        family's loss, she finds herself hungering for her childhood faith and
        grappling with the evangelical church in which she was raised, whose
        promise of salvation remains as tantalizing as it is elusive.
        Transcendent Kingdom is a deeply moving portrait of a family of Ghanaian
        immigrants ravaged by depression and addiction and grief--a novel about
        faith, science, religion, love. Exquisitely written, emotionally
        searing, this is an exceptionally powerful follow-up to Gyasi's
        phenomenal debut.
