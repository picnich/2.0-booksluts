  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        This novel is about a woman called Martha. She knows there is something
        wrong with her but she doesn't know what it is. Her husband Patrick
        thinks she is fine. He says everyone has something, the thing is just to
        keep going.
    - paragraph: >-
        Martha told Patrick before they got married that she didn't want to have
        children. He said he didn't mind either way because he has loved her
        since he was fourteen and making her happy is all that matters, although
        he does not seem able to do it.
    - paragraph: >-
        By the time Martha finds out what is wrong, it doesn't really matter
        anymore. It is too late to get the only thing she has ever wanted. Or
        maybe it will turn out that you can stop loving someone and start again
        from nothing - if you can find something else to want.
