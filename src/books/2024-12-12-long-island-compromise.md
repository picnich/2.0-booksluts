        “There has never been, in the history of all human interaction, a way
        for a woman to explain effectively that she’s calm when a man has
        suggested she isn’t.”

        “There are few things more validating than to see someone who is like
        you, and love them instead of hate them.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        In 1980, a wealthy businessman named Carl Fletcher is kidnapped from his
        driveway, brutalized, and held for ransom. He is returned to his wife
        and kids less than a week later, only slightly the worse, and the family
        moves on with their lives, resuming their prized places in the saga of
        the American dream, comforted in the realization that though their money
        may have been what endangered them, it is also what assured them their
        safety.
    - paragraph: >-
        But now, nearly forty years later, it’s clear that perhaps nobody ever
        got over anything, after all. Carl has spent the ensuing years secretly
        seeking closure to the matter of his kidnapping, while his wife, Ruth,
        has spent her potential protecting her husband’s emotional health. Their
        three grown children aren’t doing much better: Nathan’s chronic fear
        won’t allow him to advance at his law firm; Beamer, a Hollywood
        screenwriter, will consume anything—substance, foodstuff, women—in order
        to numb his own perpetual terror; and Jenny has spent her life so bent
        on proving that she’s not a product of her family’s pathology that she
        has come to define it. As they hover at the delicate precipice of a
        different kind of survival, they learn that the family fortune has
        dwindled to just about nothing, and they must face desperate questions
        about how much their wealth has played a part in both their lives’
        successes and failures.
    - paragraph: >-
        Long Island Compromise spans the entirety of one family’s history,
        winding through decades and generations, all the way to the outrageous
        present, and confronting the mainstays of American Jewish life:
        tradition, the pursuit of success, the terror of history, fear of the
        future, old wives’ tales, evil eyes, ambition, achievement, boredom,
        dybbuks, inheritance, pyramid schemes, right-wing capitalists,
        beta-blockers, psychics, and the mostly unspoken love and shared
        experience that unite a family forever.
