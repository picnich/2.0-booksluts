        “He felt the old beat of pleasure inside his body, like the rustling
        movement of light through leaves, a phrase of music from the window of a
        passing car. Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything.”

        “Lately he’s consumed by a sense that he is in fact two separate people,
        and soon he will have to choose which person to be on a full-time basis,
        and leave the other person behind.”

        “Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very
        far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever
        find out where it was or become part of it.”

        “It was culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its
        ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that
        they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose
        emotional journeys they liked to read about.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s
        popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is
        lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his
        mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and
        indelible connection grows between the two teenagers - one they are
        determined to conceal.
    - paragraph: >-
        A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin.
        Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at
        the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college,
        Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people
        and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back
        together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to
        search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are
        willing to go to save the other.
    - paragraph: >-
        Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly
        spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the
        electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and
        friendship.
