        “Memories are a lot tougher than you might think. Just like the hearts
        that hold them.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        On an unnamed island off an unnamed coast, objects are disappearing:
        first hats, then ribbons, birds, roses—until things become much more
        serious. Most of the island's inhabitants are oblivious to these
        changes, while those few imbued with the power to recall the lost
        objects live in fear of the draconian Memory Police, who are committed
        to ensuring that what has disappeared remains forgotten.
    - paragraph: >-
        When a young woman who is struggling to maintain her career as a
        novelist discovers that her editor is in danger from the Memory Police,
        she concocts a plan to hide him beneath her floorboards. As fear and
        loss close in around them, they cling to her writing as the last way of
        preserving the past.
    - paragraph: >-
        A surreal, provocative fable about the power of memory and the trauma of
        loss, The Memory Police is a stunning new work from one of the most
        exciting contemporary authors writing in any language.
