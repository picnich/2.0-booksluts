        “I was forced to acknowledge too late, much too late, that I too had
        loved, that I was capable of suffering, and that I was human after all.”

        “Being beautiful, was that for men?' 'Yes. Some women say that it is for
        ourselves. What on earth can we do with it? I could have loved myself
        whether I was hunchbacked or lame, but to be loved by others, you had to
        be beautiful.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Deep underground, thirty-nine women live imprisoned in a cage. Watched
        over by guards, the women have no memory of how they got there, no
        notion of time, and only a vague recollection of their lives before.
    - paragraph: >-
        As the burn of electric light merges day into night and numberless years
        pass, a young girl—the fortieth prisoner—sits alone and outcast in the
        corner. Soon she will show herself to be the key to the others' escape
        and survival in the strange world that awaits them above ground.

        Jacqueline Harpman was born in Etterbeek, Belgium, in 1929, and fled to
        Casablanca with her family during WWII. Informed by her background as a
        psychoanalyst and her youth in exile, I Who Have Never Known Men is a
        haunting, heartbreaking post-apocalyptic novel of female friendship and
        intimacy, and the lengths people will go to maintain their humanity in
        the face of devastation. Back in print for the first time since 1997,
        Harpman’s modern classic is an important addition to the growing canon
        of feminist speculative literature.
