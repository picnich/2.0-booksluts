        “If we could just be on earth at the same place and same time as
        everyone we loved, if we could be born together and die together, it
        would be so simple.”

        “Asher said, "Does it really ever go anywhere?" "Does what?" "Love. Does
        it vanish?" Yale looked at his own hand, resting on the dashboard to
        keep himself steady whenever Asher braked suddenly. "I mean, we never
        want it to. But it does, doesn't it?" Asher said, "I think that's the
        saddest thing in the world, the failure of love. Not hatred, but the
        failure of love.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        In 1985, Yale Tishman, the development director for an art gallery in
        Chicago, is about to pull off an amazing coup, bringing in an
        extraordinary collection of 1920s paintings as a gift to the gallery.
        Yet as his career begins to flourish, the carnage of the AIDS epidemic
        grows around him. One by one, his friends are dying and after his friend
        Nico's funeral, the virus circles closer and closer to Yale himself.
        Soon the only person he has left is Fiona, Nico's little sister.
    - paragraph: >-
        Thirty years later, Fiona is in Paris tracking down her estranged
        daughter who disappeared into a cult. While staying with an old friend,
        a famous photographer who documented the Chicago crisis, she finds
        herself finally grappling with the devastating ways AIDS affected her
        life and her relationship with her daughter. The two intertwining
        stories take us through the heartbreak of the eighties and the chaos of
        the modern world, as both Yale and Fiona struggle to find goodness in
        the midst of disaster.
    - paragraph: >-
