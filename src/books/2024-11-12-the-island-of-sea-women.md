        “They did this to me. They did that to me. A woman who thinks that way
        will never overcome her anger. You are not being punished for your
        anger. You're being punished by your anger.”

        “How do we fall in love? ... How different it is with friendship. No one
        picks a friend for us. We come together by choice. We are not tied
        together through ceremony or the responsibility to create a son. We tie
        ourselves together through moment. The spark when we first meet.
        Laughter and tears shared. Secrets packed away to be treasured, hoarded,
        and protected. The wonder that someone can be so different from you and
        yet still understand your heart in a way no one else ever will.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Set on the Korean island of Jeju, The Island of Sea Women follows Mi-ja
        and Young-sook, two girls from very different backgrounds, as they begin
        working in the sea with their village’s all-female diving collective.
        Over many decades—through the Japanese colonialism of the 1930s and
        1940s, World War II, the Korean War, and the era of cellphones and wet
        suits for the women divers—Mi-ja and Young-sook develop the closest of
        bonds. Nevertheless, their differences are impossible to ignore: Mi-ja
        is the daughter of a Japanese collaborator, forever marking her, and
        Young-sook was born into a long line of haenyeo and will inherit her
        mother’s position leading the divers. After hundreds of dives and years
        of friendship, forces outside their control will push their relationship
        to the breaking point.

        This beautiful, thoughtful novel illuminates a unique and unforgettable
        culture, one where the women are in charge, engaging in dangerous
        physical work, and the men take care of the children. A classic Lisa See
        story—one of women’s friendships and the larger forces that shape
        them—The Island of Sea Women introduces readers to the fierce female
        divers of Jeju Island and the dramatic history that shaped their lives.
