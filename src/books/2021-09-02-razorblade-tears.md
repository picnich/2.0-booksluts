        “Folks like to talk about revenge like it’s a righteous thing but it’s
        just hate in a nicer suit,”

        “Tears ran from his eyes and stung his cheeks. Tears for his son. Tears
        for his wife. Tears for the little girl they had to raise. Tears for who
        they were and what they all had lost. Each drop felt like it was slicing
        his face open like a razorblade.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Ike Randolph has been out of jail for fifteen years, with not so much as
        a speeding ticket in all that time. But a Black man with cops at the
        door knows to be afraid.
    - paragraph: >-
        The last thing he expects to hear is that his son Isiah has been
        murdered, along with Isiah’s white husband, Derek. Ike had never fully
        accepted his son but is devastated by his loss.
    - paragraph: >-
        Derek’s father Buddy Lee was almost as ashamed of Derek for being gay as
        Derek was ashamed his father was a criminal. Buddy Lee still has
        contacts in the underworld, though, and he wants to know who killed his
        boy.
    - paragraph: >-
        Ike and Buddy Lee, two ex-cons with little else in common other than a
        criminal past and a love for their dead sons, band together in their
        desperate desire for revenge. In their quest to do better for their sons
        in death than they did in life, hardened men Ike and Buddy Lee will
        confront their own prejudices about their sons and each other, as they
        rain down vengeance upon those who hurt their boys.
