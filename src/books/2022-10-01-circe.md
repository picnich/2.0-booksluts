        “But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips
        near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation
        was he to me.”

        “Humbling women seems to me a chief pastime of poets. As if there can be
        no story unless we crawl and weep.”

        “He showed me his scars, and in return he let me pretend that I had
        none.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a
        daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child--neither powerful like
        her father nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world
        of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power:
        the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and
        menace the gods themselves.
    - paragraph: >-
        Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her
        occult craft, tames wild beasts, and crosses paths with many of the most
        famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and
        his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily
        Odysseus.
    - paragraph: >-
        But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe
        unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding
        herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the
        Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her
        strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods
        she is born from or with the mortals she has come to love.
