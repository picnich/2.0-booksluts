        “How were you supposed to change- in ways both big and small- when your
        family was always there to remind you of exactly the person you
        apparently signed an ironclad contract to be?”

        “Nina understood, maybe for the first time, that letting people love you
        and care for you is part of how you love and care for them.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Four famous siblings throw an epic party to celebrate the end of the
        summer. But over the course of twenty-four hours, their lives will
        change forever.
    - paragraph: >-
        Malibu: August, 1983. It’s the day of Nina Riva’s annual end-of-summer
        party, and anticipation is at a fever pitch. Everyone wants to be around
        the famous Rivas: Nina, the talented surfer and supermodel; brothers Jay
        and Hud, one a championship surfer, the other a renowned photographer;
        and their adored baby sister, Kit. Together, the siblings are a source
        of fascination in Malibu and the world over—especially as the offspring
        of the legendary singer, Mick Riva.
    - paragraph: >-
        The only person not looking forward to the party of the year is Nina
        herself, who never wanted to be the center of attention, and who has
        also just been very publicly abandoned by her pro tennis player husband.
        Oh, and maybe Hud—because it is long past time to confess something to
        the brother from whom he’s been inseparable since birth.
    - paragraph: >-
        Jay, on the other hand, is counting the minutes until nightfall, when
        the girl he can’t stop thinking about promised she’ll be there.
    - paragraph: >-
        And Kit has a couple secrets of her own—including a guest she invited
        without consulting anyone.
    - paragraph: >-
        By midnight the party will be completely out of control. By morning, the
        Riva mansion will have gone up in flames. But before that first spark in
        the early hours before dawn, the alcohol will flow, the music will play,
        and the loves and secrets that shaped this family’s generations will all
        come bubbling to the surface.
    - paragraph: >-
        Malibu Rising is a story about one unforgettable night in the life of a
        family: the night they each have to choose what they will keep from the
        people who made them... and what they will leave behind.
