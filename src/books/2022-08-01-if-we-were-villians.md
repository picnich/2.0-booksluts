  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Oliver Marks has just served ten years in jail - for a murder he may or
        may not have committed. On the day he's released, he's greeted by the
        man who put him in prison. Detective Colborne is retiring, but before he
        does, he wants to know what really happened a decade ago.
    - paragraph: >-
        As one of seven young actors studying Shakespeare at an elite arts
        college, Oliver and his friends play the same roles onstage and off:
        hero, villain, tyrant, temptress, ingenue, extra. But when the casting
        changes, and the secondary characters usurp the stars, the plays spill
        dangerously over into life, and one of them is found dead. The rest face
        their greatest acting challenge yet: convincing the police, and
        themselves, that they are blameless.
