        “Until recently, I didn’t think that humans could choose loneliness.
        That there were sometimes forces more powerful than the wish to avoid
        loneliness.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        From her place in the store, Klara, an Artificial Friend with
        outstanding observational qualities, watches carefully the behavior of
        those who come in to browse, and of those who pass on the street
        outside. She remains hopeful that a customer will soon choose her, but
        when the possibility emerges that her circumstances may change forever,
        Klara is warned not to invest too much in the promises of humans.
    - paragraph: >-
        In Klara and the Sun, Kazuo Ishiguro looks at our rapidly changing
        modern world through the eyes of an unforgettable narrator to explore a
        fundamental question: what does it mean to love?
