        “I found it strange that no word exists for a parent who loses a child.
        If children lose their parents, they are orphans. If a husband loses his
        wife, he’s a widower. But there’s no word for a parent who loses a
        child. I’ve come to believe that the event is just too big, too
        monstrous, too overwhelming for words. No word could ever describe the
        feeling, so we leave it unsaid.”
    - highlight: “Anger is exhausting. Holding on to it will drain the life out of you.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        July 1962. A Mi’kmaq family from Nova Scotia arrives in Maine to pick
        blueberries for the summer. Weeks later, four-year-old Ruthie, the
        family’s youngest child, vanishes. She is last seen by her six-year-old
        brother, Joe, sitting on a favorite rock at the edge of a berry field.
        Joe will remain distraught by his sister’s disappearance for years to
        come.
    - paragraph: >-
        In Maine, a young girl named Norma grows up as the only child of an
        affluent family. Her father is emotionally distant, her mother
        frustratingly overprotective. Norma is often troubled by recurring
        dreams and visions that seem more like memories than imagination. As she
        grows older, Norma slowly comes to realize there is something her
        parents aren’t telling her. Unwilling to abandon her intuition, she will
        spend decades trying to uncover this family secret.

        across time.
