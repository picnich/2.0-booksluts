        “Nothing erases the past. There is repentance, there is atonement, and
        there is forgiveness. That is all, but that is enough.”

        “The universe began as an enormous breath being held. Who knows why, but
        whatever the reason, I'm glad it did, because I owe my existence to that
        fact. All my desires and ruminations are no more and no less than eddy
        currents generated by the gradual exhalation of our universe. And until
        this great exhalation is finished, my thoughts live on.”

        “Four things do not come back: the spoken word, the sped arrow, the past
        life, and the neglected opportunity”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        This much-anticipated second collection of stories is signature Ted
        Chiang, full of revelatory ideas and deeply sympathetic characters. In
        The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate, a portal through time forces a
        fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and the
        temptation of second chances. In the epistolary Exhalation, an alien
        scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his
        own people, but for all of reality. And in The Lifecycle of Software
        Objects, a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years,
        elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being.

        Also included are two brand-new stories: Omphalos and Anxiety Is the
        Dizziness of Freedom.
    - paragraph: >-
        In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the
        oldest questions on earth—What is the nature of the universe? What does
        it mean to be human?—and ones that no one else has even imagined. And,
        each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful
        science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and
        compassion.
