        “We're more than the sum total of our choices, that all the paths we
        might have taken factor somehow into the math of our identity.”

        “It's terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every
        choice we could possibly make, branches off into a new world.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Jason Dessen is walking home through the chilly Chicago streets one
        night, looking forward to a quiet evening in front of the fireplace with
        his wife, Daniela, and their son, Charlie—when his reality shatters. 
        "Are you happy with your life?"  Those are the last words Jason Dessen
        hears before the masked abductor knocks him unconscious.
    - paragraph: >-
        Before he awakens to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by
        strangers in hazmat suits.  Before a man Jason's never met smiles down
        at him and says, "Welcome back, my friend."  In this world he's woken up
        to, Jason's life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His
        son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college physics
        professor, but a celebrated genius who has achieved something
        remarkable. Something impossible.
    - paragraph: Is it this world or the other that's the dream?
    - paragraph: >-
        And even if the home he remembers is real, how can Jason possibly make
        it back to the family he loves? The answers lie in a journey more
        wondrous and horrifying than anything he could've imagined—one that will
        force him to confront the darkest parts of himself even as he battles a
        terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe.
