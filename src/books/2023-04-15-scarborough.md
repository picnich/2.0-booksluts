        City of Toronto Book Award finalist Scarborough is a low-income,
        culturally diverse neighborhood east of Toronto, the fourth largest city
        in North America; like many inner city communities, it suffers under the
        weight of poverty, drugs, crime, and urban blight. Scarborough the novel
        employs a multitude of voices to tell the story of a tight-knit
        neighborhood under among them, Victor, a black artist harassed by the
        police; Winsum, a West Indian restaurant owner struggling to keep it
        together; and Hina, a Muslim school worker who witnesses first-hand the
        impact of poverty on education. And then there are the three kids who
        work to rise above a system that consistently fails Bing, a gay Filipino
        boy who lives under the shadow of his father's mental illness; Sylvie,
        Bing's best friend, a Native girl whose family struggles to find a
        permanent home to live in; and Laura, whose history of neglect by her
        mother is destined to repeat itself with her father. Scarborough offers
        a raw yet empathetic glimpse into a troubled community that locates its
        dignity in unexpected a neighborhood that refuses to be undone.
