        “I thought—I want to go home. I want to be in a place that feels like
        home. Where that was, I did not know.”

        “It is surprisingly easy to forget what you have witnesses, the
        horrifying image or the voice speaking the unspeakable, in order to
        exist in the world we must and we do forget, we live in a state of I
        know but I do not know.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Anovel from the author of A Separation, a taut and electrifying story
        about a woman caught between many truths.
    - paragraph: >-
        An interpreter has come to The Hague to escape New York and work at the
        International Court. A woman of many languages and identities, she is
        looking for a place to finally call home.
    - paragraph: >-
        She's drawn into simmering personal dramas: her lover, Adriaan, is
        separated from his wife but still entangled in his marriage. Her friend
        Jana witnesses a seemingly random act of violence, a crime the
        interpreter becomes increasingly obsessed with as she befriends the
        victim's sister. And she's pulled into explosive political fires: her
        work interpreting for a former president accused of war crimes becomes
        precarious as their relationship is unbound by shifting language and
        meaning.
    - paragraph: >-
        This woman is the voice in the ear of many, but what command does that
        give her, and how vulnerable does that leave her? Her coolly impassioned
        views on power, love, and violence, are tested, both in her personal
        intimacies and in her role at the Court. She is soon pushed to the
        precipice, where betrayal and heartbreak threaten to overwhelm her; it
        is her drive towards truth, and love, that throws into stark relief what
        she wants from her life.
