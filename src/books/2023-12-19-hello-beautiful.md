        “You’re depressed, not crazy. It’s not insane to be depressed in this
        world. It’s more sane than being happy. I never trust those upbeat
        individuals who grin no matter what’s going on. Those are the ones with
        a screw loose, if you ask me.”

        “She was no longer who she used to be, and she wasn't yet whoever she
        was becoming.”

        “When an old person dies,” Kent said, “even if that person is wonderful,
        he or she is still somewhat ready, and so are the people who loved them.
        They’re like old trees, whose roots have loosened in the ground. They
        fall gently. But when someone like your aunt Sylvie dies—before her
        time—her roots get pulled out and the ground is ripped up. Everyone
        nearby is in danger of being knocked over.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        William Waters grew up in a house silenced by tragedy, where his parents
        could hardly bear to look at him, much less love him. So it’s a relief
        when his skill on the basketball court earns him a scholarship to
        college, far away from his childhood home. He soon meets Julia Padavano,
        a spirited and ambitious young woman who surprises William with her
        appreciation of his quiet steadiness. With Julia comes her family; she
        is inseparable from her three younger sisters: Sylvie, the dreamer, is
        happiest with her nose in a book and imagines a future different from
        the expected path of wife and mother; Cecelia, the family’s artist; and
        Emeline, who patiently takes care of all of them. Happily, the Padavanos
        fold Julia’s new boyfriend into their loving, chaotic household.

        But then darkness from William’s past surfaces, jeopardizing not only
        Julia’s carefully orchestrated plans for their future, but the sisters’
        unshakeable loyalty to one another. The result is a catastrophic family
        rift that changes their lives for generations. Will the loyalty that
        once rooted them be strong enough to draw them back together when it
        matters most?
    - paragraph: >-
        Vibrating with tenderness, Hello Beautiful is a gorgeous, profoundly
        moving portrait of what’s possible when we choose to love someone not in
        spite of who they are, but because of it.
