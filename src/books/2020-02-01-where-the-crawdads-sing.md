        “His dad had told him many times that the definition of a real man is
        one who cries without shame, reads poetry with his heart, feels opera in
        his soul, and does what’s necessary to defend a woman.”

        “She laughed for his sake, something she’d never done. Giving away
        another piece of herself just to have someone else.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet
        fishing village. Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite
        society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead,
        locals immediately suspect her.
    - paragraph: >-
        But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of
        school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways
        of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has
        the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns
        to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each
        intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling
        world–until the unthinkable happens.
    - paragraph: >-
        In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the
        natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting
        mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel
        reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also
        subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.
    - paragraph: >-
        The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman,
        who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The
        clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural
        histories of its wild creatures.
