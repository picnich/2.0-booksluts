        “Dormant true love, there for everybody, just waiting to be found,
        erupting when the thread of existence collides with chance and the eyes
        of two lovers meet. Boom. From what I’ve seen of it, true love is hard.
        Real romance has death in it. It has midnight shakes and flecks of shit
        across a bedsheet. True love like this dies if it has to wait for fate.
        True love like this asks lovers to cast aside what is meant to be and
        work with what is.”
    - highlight: “Do your time before it does you.”
