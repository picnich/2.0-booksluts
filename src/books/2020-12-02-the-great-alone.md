        “Books are the mile markers of my life. Some people have family photos
        or home movies to record their past. I’ve got books. Characters. For as
        long as I can remember, books have been my safe place.”

        “A girl was like a kite; without her mother's strong, steady hold on the
        string, she might just float away, be lost somewhere among the clouds.”

        “You know what they say about finding a man in Alaska—the odds are good,
        but the goods are odd.”

        “In the silence, Leni wondered if one person could ever really save
        another, or if it was the kind of thing you had to do for yourself.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Alaska, 1974. Unpredictable. Unforgiving. Untamed. For a family in
        crisis, the ultimate test of survival.
    - paragraph: >-
        Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed
        and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive
        decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live
        off the grid in America’s last true frontier.
    - paragraph: >-
        Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time,
        caught in the riptide of her parents’ passionate, stormy relationship,
        dares to hope that a new land will lead to a better future for her
        family. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will
        do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means
        following him into the unknown.
    - paragraph: >-
        At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild,
        remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community
        of strong men and even stronger women. The long, sunlit days and the
        generosity of the locals make up for the Allbrights’ lack of preparation
        and dwindling resources.
    - paragraph: >-
        But as winter approaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt’s fragile
        mental state deteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the
        perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small
        cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and
        her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own. In the wild,
        there is no one to save them but themselves.
    - paragraph: >-
        In this unforgettable portrait of human frailty and resilience, Kristin
        Hannah reveals the indomitable character of the modern American pioneer
        and the spirit of a vanishing Alaska―a place of incomparable beauty and
        danger. The Great Alone is a daring, beautiful, stay-up-all-night story
        about love and loss, the fight for survival, and the wildness that lives
        in both man and nature.
