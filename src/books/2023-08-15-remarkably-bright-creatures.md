  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Remarkably Bright Creatures, an exploration of friendship, reckoning,
        and hope, tracing a widow's unlikely connection with a giant Pacific
        octopus.
    - paragraph: >-
        After Tova Sullivan's husband died, she began working the night shift at
        the Sowell Bay Aquarium, mopping floors and tidying up. Keeping busy has
        always helped her cope, which she's been doing since her
        eighteen-year-old son, Erik, mysteriously vanished on a boat in Puget
        Sound over thirty years ago.
    - paragraph: >-
        Tova becomes acquainted with curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific
        octopus living at the aquarium. Marcellus knows more than anyone can
        imagine but wouldn't dream of lifting one of his eight arms for his
        human captors--until he forms a remarkable friendship with Tova.
    - paragraph: >-
        Ever the detective, Marcellus deduces what happened the night Tova's son
        disappeared. And now Marcellus must use every trick his old invertebrate
        body can muster to unearth the truth for her before it's too late.
    - paragraph: >-
        Shelby Van Pelt's debut novel is a gentle reminder that sometimes taking
        a hard look at the past can help uncover a future that once felt
        impossible.
