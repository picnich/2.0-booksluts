        “The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing,
        and lose so much in between.”

        “There’s this thing that happens, let’s say at school where a bunch of
        guys are in the bathroom, at the urinal, laughing about some dork that
        made an anus of himself in gym. You’re all basically nice guys, right?
        You know right from wrong, and would not in a million years be brutal to
        the poor guy’s face. And then it happens: the dork was in the shitter.
        He comes out of the stall with this look. He heard everything. And you
        realize you’re not really that nice of a guy. This is what I would say
        if I could, to all smart people of the world with their dumb hillbilly
        jokes: We are right here in the stall. We can actually hear you.”

  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Set in the mountains of southern Appalachia, this is the story of a boy
        born to a teenaged single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no
        assets beyond his dead father's good looks and copper-colored hair, a
        caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival. In a plot that never
        pauses for breath, relayed in his own unsparing voice, he braves the
        modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic
        success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all
        of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where
        even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.
    - paragraph: >-
        Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield from his
        experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to
        children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours.
        Dickens is not a prerequisite for readers of this novel, but he provided
        its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the
        contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens' anger
        and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of
        a good story. Demon Copperhead speaks for a new generation of lost boys,
        and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can't imagine
        leaving behind.
