        “You are not fool’s gold, shining only under a particular light.
        Whomever you become, whatever you make yourself into, that is who you
        always were.”

        “You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them,” she says
        now. “You can miss a person every day, and still be glad that they are
        no longer in your life.”

        “My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful,
        emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be
        as strong as theirs.”

        “We are all of us more complicated than the roles we are assigned in the

  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to
        survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the
        world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her
        "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother,
        a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's
        junkyard.
    - paragraph: >-
        Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse.
        Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at
        home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society
        that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and
        no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.
    - paragraph: >-
        Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She
        taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham
        Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time
        about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights
        movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over
        oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then
        would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way
        home.
    - paragraph: >-
        Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale
        of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the
        closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great
        writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets
        to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective
        to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.
