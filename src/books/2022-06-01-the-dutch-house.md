        “I see the past as it actually was," Maeve said. She was looking at the
        trees. "But we overlay the present onto the past. We look back through
        the lens of what we know now, so we're not seeing it as the people we
        were, we're seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has
        been radically altered.”

        “There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you'd
        been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land
        on is not yet in place, and for a moment you're suspended knowing
        nothing and no one, not even yourself.”
  summary:
    - paragraph: >-
        At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a
        single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire,
        propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order
        of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs
        outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house
        sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.
    - paragraph: >-
        The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the
        brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house
        where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are
        thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find
        that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakable
        bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.
    - paragraph: >-
        Set over the course of five decades, The Dutch House is a dark fairy
        tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. Despite
        every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly
        comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives, they return
        to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage. But
        when at last they’re forced to confront the people who left them behind,
        the relationship between an indulged brother and his ever-protective
        sister is finally tested.
